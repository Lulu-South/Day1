  <p>I thought D has a boyfrined who is a Min. but I was wrong cuz
  <font color="pink"> <strong> she told me he is just <u>a frined </u> with her.</strong></font></strong>
  <br>I felt so much better and it console me haha but i'm still not sure that i could go out with this girl. let's just see how it's gonna work and be better :)

  <p>oh dang i've had a trauma which is whenever i play a guitar for any girl who made me crush on,
  that relationship with this girl won't get a deeper. But I wanna break this trauma that i have through this opportunity indeed.</p>

  <p><h2>everything that i've already wrote was bull shit cuz <u>D doesn't have a boyfriend</u> even this guy wasn't a Min. </h2></p>

  <P> <font color="pink"><strong>9th July</strong></font> today, i wore a kind of pink shirt and blue jean at work and she wore a green cardigeon and blue jean.
  <u>this made me get crazy so much cuz i really love this kind of styling like wearing cardigeon instead of shirt shooooot</u> </p>

  <p><strong><font color="pink">19th July</font></strong> yesterday unfortunately i mean ironically fortunately i went Kareoke with Daye cuz she wasn't feeling well
    so i suggested to go there and tried to make her feel better and it worked very well i think. and we got more relationship than before. it was good til here tho.
    after this amazing time and we walked to Daye's house together. we holded each hands sometimes and we really enjoyed the time came back to house but
    suddenly she said "hold on, there is a my brother there.." and we met him who got angry so much cuz this girl didn't take phone call from her parents and him.
    we just got embarresed so much and I said to him " I'm really sorry you to make worry about this girl so much." and we said farewell and i came back to home.
    and even i thought we were supposed to meet tommorrow after her working at 11pm. but i just thought we can't just can't. but this girl!! this is why i love this
    lovely girl so much cuz she said <u>"would u mind to meet tommorrow afternoon instead of night?"</u> <strong>oh my days</strong> obviously i told her yes yes! sure
    why not? and i was glad to hear that and today we met again at Bupyeon park with my puppy Gureum. and we walked together and we had a chill in same the cafe where we've
    been before time. and we had a such a good conversation and we got a little bit more knowledges about each other. then i let her go to work and i just came back with my puppy
    and happy & lovely emotion that i got from this lovely girl.
